### An ultra-simplified explanation  :thumbsup:

<i>Primarily written for my own benefit, but hopefully helpful to someone else as well. Here I try to make them stick in to your mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the simplest way possible. Contributions are always welcome.</i>

## Introduction
Let's start this explanation talking about something crucial for our lives: the [kilogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram). Bare with me. This will make sense in a minute.


So, what about it?
Well, the kilogram is the base unit of mass, meaning that everything related to weight will be mensured upon it. This unit makes possible that people define amounts of something without missunderstandings, once the kilogram is a common language for the purpose. So, when you order 3kg of bananas, you know exactly what you are asking for and simply trust in the saller.

But there is a problem here. For many years the kilogram was actually a physical object. Got the issue already? What garantiee that 1kg is, in fact, 1kg? If the object that represents the kilogram changes over the time, the kilogram is no longer a kilogram, because the object is the kilogram itself. Getting it?

For that reason, researchers started to work on a way to transform the kilogram into a concept instead of a object (i.e. Avogadro project). Objects can be corrupted. Concepts cannot!

With that been said, the next question is: what is the base unit for business?
There anwser is TRUST!
> I trust everyone. It's the devil inside the person I don't trust. (The italian job)

As simple as it sounds, trust is the biggest gap when it comes to make business. Think about: why do we need banks? For conviniance?


Wikipedia says
> A blockchain is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block.[...] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network. 


Real world example:
> Think about your family. Think about all moments that you have been shared. At some point, your coolest uncle asks if you remember that trip to planet Mars. "It was awesome, wasn't it?" he asks. You, confused, start to ask yourself if this trip has happened ever. You ask to your mom, your dad, your brother, sister, cousin. None of them has any knowledge about this memory. Since all your relatives share same memories than you, you choose to trust in the majority instead of your uncle alone. 

See, you and your family have been implementing blockchain for years.

## So who it works?
Comming soon.
