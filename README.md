### An ultra-simplified explanation  :thumbsup:

<i>Primarily written for my own benefit, but hopefully helpful to someone else as well. Here I try to make them stick in to your mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the simplest way possible. Contributions are always welcome.</i>

## Introduction
Lets start this explanation talking about some mesurement units: kilogram, meter, liter




the [KILOGRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram). It is a unit of mass. It has thousand grams, right? Good. What is a gram then?


What is a KILOGRAM? Thousand grams, maybe? What is a gram then? What is a inch? What is a liter? You see, all these units mesurements have something in common: they a actually a physical object. A real "thing", that if changes, also changes the mesurement itself.

I will start my explanation with something that is happening on scientific field in this very moment.

Think about the "Kilogram". 


Wikipedia says
> A blockchain is a distributed database that is used to maintain a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block.[...] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the collusion of the network. 


Real world example:
> Think about your family. Think about all moments that you have been shared. At some point, your coolest uncle asks if you remember that trip to planet Mars. "It was awesome, wasn't it?" he asks. You, confused, start to ask yourself if this trip has happened ever. You ask to your mom, your dad, your brother, sister, cousin. None of them has any knowledge about this memory. Since all your relatives share same memories than you, you choose to trust in the majority instead of your uncle alone. 

**You and your family have been implementing blockchain for years.** 




Lets start talking a bit about TRUST!
> I trust everyone. It's the devil inside the person I don't trust. (The italian job)
